# Time Series Clustering and Longitudinal Analysis
"How can we get the most out of a time series data using longitudinal methods?". This is the main question that this repository attempts to answer. There are various time series analysis methods, however some are more suitbale for a specific data. I will discuss these methods in two broad categories: 

1. **Statstical Methods**: methods that make specific assumptions on the data and take into account the uncertainty of the data. This leads to conclusions that are inherintly very intepratible, but some downsides such as if the assumptions are not entirely accurate the results will not be correct.
2. **Machine Learning Methods**: This is the area of unsuprevised time series clustering methods. These method make no specific assumptions on the distrubtion of the data and attempts to cluster the data based on the learning algorithms.

In one of [Frank Harrel's blog posts at Stastical Thinking](https://www.fharrell.com/post/stat-ml/) makes a clear and intriguing distinction between these two which I defintiley recommend reading it. 
However this ditinction also extends to time series analysis and it's important to know what to use in which setting.
 
I will delve into each of these methods and their differences in specific examples, and make conclusions based on their assumptions.
The main project that I used to work with is not publicly available, however I will work with a specific dataset that is publicly availble and the results can be reproduced.
